> **Supercharge your workflow with AI.**

EM TaskFlow AI is a next-generation productivity assistant that unifies your Jira, Notion, and Google Calendar data, then empowers you with actionable insights, smart suggestions, and automation—powered by the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, HuggingFace, and more.

## 🛠️ Quickstart: Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm
- (Optional for advanced deployment) Python 3.10+ and Docker

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd em-taskflow
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env  # Fill in your API keys and config
npm install
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Run in Development
- **Backend:**
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm start  # or: node src/index.js
  ```
- **Frontend:**
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm start
  ```
- The frontend will proxy API requests to the backend (see `frontend/package.json`).

## 🌐 Production Deployment Guide

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Configure all API keys and settings in `backend/.env` (see `.env.example`).
2. **Build the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Serve Frontend with Backend (Optional):**
   - Copy `build` to backend and serve with Express, or deploy separately (Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Render/Heroku for backend).
4. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Deploy to your favorite Node.js host, or use Docker:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:18
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY backend/ .
     RUN npm install
     CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
     ```
5. **(Optional) Python/FastAPI Migration:**
   - The backend is modular and ready for advanced AI workflows in Python if needed.

---

## 💡 Extending & Customizing
- **Add LLM Providers:** Plug in Gemini, DeepSeek, or your own models in `backend/src/services/llmService.js`.
- **Create New Automations:** Add smart features and expose via API.
- **Customize the UI:** Make the React frontend your own.
