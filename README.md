## 🛠️ Quickstart: Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm
- (Optional for advanced deployment) Python 3.10+ and Docker

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/logsv/em-taskflow-ai.git
cd em-taskflow
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env  # Fill in your API keys and config
npm install
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Run in Development
- **Backend:**
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm start  # or: node src/index.js
  ```
- **Frontend:**
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm start
  ```
- The frontend will proxy API requests to the backend (see `frontend/package.json`).

## 🌐 Production Deployment Guide

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Configure all API keys and settings in `backend/.env` (see `.env.example`).
2. **Build the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Serve Frontend with Backend (Optional):**
   - Copy `build` to backend and serve with Express, or deploy separately (Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Render/Heroku for backend).
4. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Deploy to your favorite Node.js host, or use Docker:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:18
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY backend/ .
     RUN npm install
     CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
     ```
5. **(Optional) Python/FastAPI Migration:**
   - The backend is modular and ready for advanced AI workflows in Python if needed.

---

## 💡 Extending & Customizing
- **Add LLM Providers:** Plug in Gemini, DeepSeek, or your own models in `backend/src/services/llmService.js`.
- **Create New Automations:** Add smart features and expose via API.
- **Customize the UI:** Make the React frontend your own, leveraging the new `NavBar` component and updated styling.
