# Plan to Fix Breaking Test Cases

This document outlines the plan to identify and fix the breaking test cases in the project.

## 1. Run End-to-End Tests

- I will run curl commands to test all backend routes.
- I will analyze the output of the curl commands to identify any failures.

## 2. Analyze the Cause of Failures

- I will examine the code for the failing routes and the corresponding application code.
- I will identify the root cause of each failure. This could be due to recent code changes, dependency issues, or problems with the test environment.

## 3. Outline Steps to Fix the Tests

- I will create a detailed plan to fix each of the identified issues.
- The plan will include the specific code changes required to fix the tests.
- I will then move on to fixing the unit tests.

## 4. Verify the Fixes

- After applying the fixes, I will run the curl commands and the test suite again to ensure that all tests pass.
- I will also perform regression testing to ensure that the fixes have not introduced any new bugs.
